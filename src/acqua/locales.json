    "description": "QISKit ACQUA provides a library of cross-domain quantum algorithms upon which domain-specific applications for near term quantum computing can be built.  QISKit ACQUA is designed to be extensible, and uses a pluggable framework where classical computational programs, quantum algorithms and support objects used by algorithms (optimizers, variational forms, oracles, etc.) can easily be added. QISKit ACQUA provides both programmable and graphical user interfaces with schema-enforced configuration correctness.",
    "chemistryDescription": "QISKit ACQUA Chemistry is a set of tools and algorithms that enable experimenting with chemistry problems via quantum computing.  QISKit ACQUA Chemistry translates chemistry-specific problems into inputs for a QISKit ACQUA algorithm, which in turn uses QISKit Core for the actual quantum computation.  Users can continue to configure chemistry problems on their favorite classical chemistry computational programs, such as Gaussianâ„¢, PSI4, PySCF and PyQuante.  QISKit ACQUA Chemistry provides both programmable and graphical user interfaces with schema-enforced configuration correctness.",
    "aiDescription": "QISKit ACQUA Artificial Intelligence is a set of tools and algorithms that enable experimenting with  AI problems via quantum computing.  QISKit ACQUA AI translates AI-specific problems into inputs for a QISKit ACQUA algorithm, which in turn uses QISKit Core for the actual quantum computation.  QISKit ACQUA AI provides both programmable and graphical user interfaces with schema-enforced configuration correctness.",
    "optimizationDescription": "QISKit ACQUA Optimization is a set of tools and algorithms that enable experimenting with optimization problems via quantum computing.  QISKit ACQUA Optimization translates optimization-specific problems into inputs for a QISKit ACQUA algorithm, which in turn uses QISKit Core for the actual quantum computation.  QISKit ACQUA Optimization provides both programmable and graphical user interfaces with schema-enforced configuration correctness.",
